# Visiting the Fielding School of Public Health, UCLA

Since 1st September, I am with the [WORLD Policy Analysis Center](http://worldpolicycenter.org/). The purpose of my stay is to get to know what the Center is working on, learn about how they produce their data, and use some of their variables on [poverty reduction](http://worldpolicycenter.org/topics/poverty/policies). I am looking forward to integrate some of their work with mine.
