# Visiting the Department of Economics, the New School For Social Research, New York, the US.

Between 15th February and 31st August 2015, I was a visiting [the Department of Economics, the New School For Social Research](http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/economics/). The purpose of my visit was to engage on a project on the impact of the recent economic crisis on inequality with [Professor Sanjay Reddy](http://www.sanjayreddy.com/). We also explored ways to  generalizing Amartya Sen´s entitlement approach to areas beyond food insecurity. 

Professor Reddy has been working on develoment, global issues, and poverty reserach for over a decade now. It was a true pleasure to get to know him and I am looking forward to continuing our collaboration.
