# Visiting the Fielding School of Public Health, UCLA

Between  1st of September, 2013, and 31st of January, 2015, I was a visiting scholar at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies](http://www.mpifg.de/index_en.asp). During my stay I was part of the sociology of markets research group, led by Prof. Jens Beckert.
