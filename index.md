I work on figuring out why we have so much poverty in a world of plenty. My research revolves around the question why societies often value financial resources, over peoples´ health – or worse, lives. Another focal point is how children suffer because of dysfunctional governments (and institutions) that wage war with its neighbouring countries; or because their families stood in their way for education. Societies can only improve, if the opportunities for its children cultivates – so children can flourish. 

I pursue to examine these question preferably by using well-founded social theorizing combined with large data, and robust methodologies. For these reasons, my work tends to be quantitative and theoretical. I seek to learn and implement new techniques (e.g. [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)) and ways of picturing insightful visualizations of information (inspired by [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)). 

I happened to have a Ph.D. in sociology, but could have equally had it in economics, political science, or mathematics. I work with colleagues from various disciplines and several countries (most notably, the US, the UK, Germany, France, Sweden).

My normative aim is – to borrow from Aristotle´s idea on eudaimonia – to contribute to the betterment of our global society so all individuals can flourish. My research is a small piece adding to that.
